University of Arizona coding bootcamp challenge 1- HTML/CSS Refactor

    User story:
        As A marketing agency
        I want a codebase that follows accessibility standards
        so that our own site is optimized for search engines

    Accessibility standards:
        1. Semantic HTML elements in the source code
        2. Elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
        3. Image elements contain accessible alt attributes
        4. Heading attributes are in sequential order
        5. There is a concice, descriptive title


Our goal is to improve the websites accessability to make it appear more in search engines. The main changes that are commited to the starter code are the additions of semantic tags, descriptive <alt> on all images, and an overall reorginization of the code in a more logical manner. A link to the webpage can be found <a href="index.html" target="_blank">here</a>
